# Workout Blueprint

[Project Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/zvImh4my/workout-blueprint-app "Workout Blueprint App | Trello")

Workout Blueprint is a workout planning application utilising Arnold's Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding. 

While in development, it is intended to be only two things:
1) A revision of SQL / general database practice for myself
2) A potential bodybuilding program creator to be used (at least for now) only by myself (and maybe a training partner).

As such, the development pattern is quite unstructured.
